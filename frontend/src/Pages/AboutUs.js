  Individuals served by SCOPE enjoy a flexible program and service that is customized according to their own preferences and needs. One size does not fit all, and every individual is entitled to pursue their dreams and goals on their terms. Person-centred planning is the cornerstone of SCOPEâ€™s values and services.

  <p class="container-text1">  
  SCOPE is a leader in the community of disability services, specializing in creative ways of helping individuals live full lives in a community setting regardless of their level of need. Its services are frequently sought for a smaller proportion of individuals who have had repeated unsuccessful placements or chronic hospitalization.
  </p>
  <p class="container-text1">  
  We believe that the best services are based on a relationship; our role is to create services that work for the individual.
